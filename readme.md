# Rust Hashmaps

A very simple implementation of hashmaps from scratch in Rust. Supports generics so any hashable type can be the key and supports any value type.

"Bucket size" is fixed at 16 buckets, so when there are 16 items you will always have some linear search involved. Just a toy example to test my skills in Rust as I am a beginner with the language.
